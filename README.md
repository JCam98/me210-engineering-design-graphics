# ME 210 - Engineering Design Graphics

## Description
This is an academic coursework repository containing a reverse engineering project for the course, ME 210: Engineering Design Graphics. This project documents a comprehensive reverse engineering analysis of a Nerf Rebelle toy blaster conducted as part of a mechanical engineering design course. The objective was to disassemble the product, understand its functional subsystems, and recreate the design through detailed engineering documentation and analysis. The work includes exploded assembly and sub-assembly sketches, mass properties evaluation, finite element analysis (FEA) of critical components under multiple load cases, and fully dimensioned orthographic drawings. Based on structural and performance insights gained from the analysis, a targeted redesign was proposed to improve component performance while maintaining functionality. Overall, the project demonstrates a structured approach to product teardown, mechanical analysis, and design improvement using industry-standard engineering methods and tools.
