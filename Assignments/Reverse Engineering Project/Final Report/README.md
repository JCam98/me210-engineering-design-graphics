# Reverse Engineering Project

## Problem Statement

Plastic consumer products experience repeated mechanical loading that can lead to deformation or failure if not properly designed. Evaluating how internal components distribute stress and respond to applied loads is essential for improving durability, safety, and performance. This project addresses the need to assess the structural behavior of a commercial toy blaster through reverse engineering and analysis.

## Project Description & Purpose

This project reverse engineered a Nerf Rebelle toy blaster to examine its internal structure, component geometry, and load-bearing behavior. The goal was to document the design, evaluate structural performance under representative loading conditions, and identify opportunities for design improvement based on analytical results.

## Solution Approach

The blaster was disassembled and documented using exploded assembly sketches, mass property analysis, and detailed orthographic drawings. Finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted on key components to evaluate displacement, strain, and stress under applied loads of 75 N, 200 N, and 300 N. Simulation results informed a redesigned component geometry aimed at improving structural performance.

## Key Findings & Takeaways

FEA results identified stress concentrations and deformation patterns that increased with applied load, revealing design limitations in the original geometry. The redesigned component reduced stress concentrations through modified dimensions and improved load distribution. Overall, the project demonstrates how reverse engineering combined with FEA can guide effective, data-driven product design improvements.

## Tech Stack

This project involved the use of Solidworks as the Computer-Aided Design tool.
